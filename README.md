Big Data Video Analysis
Java, Hadoop, Map -Reduce                                                                                                                                            
this is a motion detection application for security purposes which is extendable to build automation tools 
•	Designed an algorithm which involves video to frame conversion, grey-scale conversion and background subtraction
•	Made use of Hadoop API and map-reduce to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by 10 times for a 2-minute video clip
